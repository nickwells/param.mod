/*

Package paramset offers helper functions for creating a new
param.PSet. You should almost always use the paramset.New(...) function
which will create a new param.PSet with the standard helper set up. You
would typically pass it a list of param.ParamSetOptFunc's which can be used,
for instance, to add the params to the PSet.
