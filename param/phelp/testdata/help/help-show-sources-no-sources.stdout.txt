Alternative Sources

Program parameters may be set through the command line but also through these
additional sources.

  Group Configuration Files

    common.params-completion:  /home/ngw/.config/github.com/nickwells/param.mod/v4/param/phelp/group-common.params-completion.cfg

    Note: parameters given in group config files must be valid parameters of the
          program and members of the parameter group.

Note: additional sources are processed in the order shown above and then the
      command line parameters are processed. This means that a value given on
      the command line will replace any settings in configuration files or
      environment variables (unless the parameter may only be set once).
      Similarly, settings in sources higher up this page can be replaced by
      settings in sources lower down the page

The following parameters may be useful when working with these alternative
sources:
    params-show-where-set : will show if values have been set from any of the
                            alternative sources.
    params-show-unused    : can be useful to check that parameters set in
                            alternative sources are all correct. Since some
                            shared config files can contain parameters intended
                            for other programs misspelled parameters may be
                            silently ignored. With this parameter you can see
                            all the potential parameters and check them.
