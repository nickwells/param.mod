      [-help-show-groups] or [-help-groups]
            print the parameter groups that have been set up. Do not show the
            individual parameters in those groups.
            
            This lets you see just the available groups of parameters and choose
            which you want to select for closer examination.
            
            The program will exit after the help message is shown.
      [-help] or [-usage]
            print a help message explaining what the program does and the
            available parameters.
            
            Optional parameters are shown surrounded by square brackets
            [like-this]. Parameters which take a value are shown with a
            following '=...', this is itself bracketed if the value may be
            omitted.
            
            Parameters which are less commonly useful will not be shown. To see
            these hidden parameters use the help-full parameter.
            
            The parameters are arranged into named groups (this parameter is in
            'common.params-help') which can be selected or suppressed through
            other help parameters. Within each group the parameters are
            displayed in alphabetical order.
            
            Groups where all the parameters are hidden will not be shown. To see
            all the available parameter groups use the help-show-groups
            parameter.
            
            For a shorter help message use the help-summary parameter
            
            The program will exit after the help message is shown.
