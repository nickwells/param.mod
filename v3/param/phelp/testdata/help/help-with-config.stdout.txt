a description of what the program does

With embedded new lines (help-with-config)

Usage: PROGRAM NAME UNKNOWN ...
---------------
common.params-help [ 10 parameters, 9 hidden ]
    These are parameters which control whether and how to print a message
    explaining how the program can be used.

      [-help] or [-usage]
            print a help message explaining what the program does and the
            available parameters.
            
            The parameters are arranged into named groups (this parameter is in
            'common.params-help') which can be selected or suppressed through
            other help parameters. Within each group the parameters are
            displayed in alphabetical order. To see all the available parameter
            groups use the help-groups parameter.
            
            Optional parameters are shown surrounded by square brackets
            [like-this]. Parameters which take a value are shown with a
            following '=...', this is itself bracketed if the value may be
            omitted.
            
            Parameters which are less commonly useful will not be shown. To see
            these hidden parameters use the help-full parameter.
            
            For a shorter help message use the help-summary parameter
            
            The program will exit after the parameters are processed.
            
            This parameter value may only be given on the command line not in
            configuration files or as an environment variable.
---------------
test-group1 [ 6 parameters, 1 hidden ]
    test parameters.
    
    Parameters in this group may also be set in one of the configuration files:
    testdata/configFiles/cfg1 (must exist)
    testdata/configFiles/cfg2
    

      [-param1=...] or [-param1-alt1=...]
            help text for param1
            
            This parameter value may only be given on the command line not in
            configuration files or as an environment variable.
            Allowed values: any value that can be read as a whole number
            Initial value: 1
      -param2=... or -param2-alt2=...
            help text for param2.
            With an embedded new line and a lot of text to demonstrate the
            behaviour when text is wrapped across multiple lines
            Allowed values: (see parameter: param1)
            Initial value: 2
      [-param4[=...]]
            help...
            
            This parameter value may only be set once. Any appearances after the
            first will not be used
            Allowed values: none (which will be taken as 'true') or some value
                            that can be interpreted as true or false. The value
                            must be given after an '=', not as a following
                            value, as this is optional
            Initial value: false
      [-param5=...]
            help...
            Allowed values: a string
                            The value must be one of the following:
                            v1: a value
                            v2: another value
            Initial value: v1
      [-param6=...]
            help...
            Allowed values: (see parameter: param5)
            Initial value: v2
---------------

    Note: Optional parameter values (where the name is followed by [=...]) must
          come after an '=' rather than as the next argument. As follows,
          
          -xxx=false not -xxx false
          
          For parameters which must have a value it may be given in either way

Alternative Sources

This program may also be configured through the following alternative sources.
These are in addition to the parameters supplied on the command line.


  Group Configuration Files

    test-group1:  testdata/configFiles/cfg1 (must exist)
    test-group1:  testdata/configFiles/cfg2

    Note: the order in which groups are processed is indeterminate but within
          each group the files are processed in the order listed above.

    Note: parameters given in the group config files must be valid parameters of
          the program and they must be members of the parameter group.

  Common Configuration Files

      testdata/configFiles/cfg3 (must exist)
      testdata/configFiles/cfg4
    * testdata/configFiles/cfg5 (must exist)
    * testdata/configFiles/cfg6

    Note: the files marked with a '*' should only contain parameters valid for
          this program.

  Environment Variables

    The program can also be configured through environment variables prefixed
    with:
    A_,
    B_ or
    C_

    Note: The prefix is stripped off and any underscores ('_') in the
          environment variable name after the prefix will be replaced with
          dashes ('-') when matching the parameter name.
          
          For instance, if the environment variables prefixes include 'XX_' an
          environment variable called 'XX_a_b' will match a parameter called
          'a-b'

Note: these additional sources are processed in the order shown above and then
      the command line parameters are processed. This means that a value given
      on the command line will replace any other settings in configuration files
      or environment variables (unless the parameter may only be set once).
      Similarly, settings in sources higher up this page can be replaced by
      settings in sources lower in the page
