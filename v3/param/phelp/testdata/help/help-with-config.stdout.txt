a description of what the program does

With embedded new lines (help-with-config)

Usage: PROGRAM NAME UNKNOWN ...
---------------
common.params-help [ 12 parameters, 11 hidden ]
    These are parameters which control whether and how to print a message
    explaining how the program can be used.

      [-help] or [-usage]
            print a help message explaining what the program does and the
            available parameters.
            
            Optional parameters are shown surrounded by square brackets
            [like-this]. Parameters which take a value are shown with a
            following '=...', this is itself bracketed if the value may be
            omitted.
            
            Parameters which are less commonly useful will not be shown. To see
            these hidden parameters use the help-full parameter.
            
            The parameters are arranged into named groups (this parameter is in
            'common.params-help') which can be selected or suppressed through
            other help parameters. Within each group the parameters are
            displayed in alphabetical order.
            
            Groups where all the parameters are hidden will not be shown. To see
            all the available parameter groups use the help-show-groups
            parameter.
            
            For a shorter help message use the help-summary parameter
            
            The program will exit after the help message is shown.
            
            This parameter may only be given on the command line, not in the
            configuration files or as an environment variable
---------------
test-group1 [ 6 parameters, 1 hidden ]
    test parameters.
    
    Parameters in this group may also be set in one of the configuration files:
    testdata/configFiles/cfg1 (must exist)
    testdata/configFiles/cfg2

      [-param1=...] or [-param1-alt1=...]
            help text for param1
            
            This parameter may only be given on the command line, not in the
            configuration files or as an environment variable
            Allowed values: any value that can be read as a whole number
            Initial value: 1
      -param2=... or -param2-alt2=...
            help text for param2.
            With an embedded new line and a lot of text to demonstrate the
            behaviour when text is wrapped across multiple lines
            Allowed values: (see parameter: param1)
            Initial value: 2
      [-param4[=...]]
            help...
            
            This parameter value may only be set once. Any appearances after the
            first will not be used
            Allowed values: none (which will be taken as 'true') or some value
                            that can be interpreted as true or false. The value
                            must be given after an '=', not as a following
                            value, as this is optional
            Initial value: false
      [-param5=...]
            help...
            Allowed values: a string
                            The value must be one of the following:
                            v1: a value
                            v2: another value
            Initial value: v1
      [-param6=...]
            help...
            Allowed values: (see parameter: param5)
            Initial value: v2
---------------

    Note: Optional parameter values (where the name is followed by [=...]) must
          come after an '=' rather than as the next argument. As follows,
          
          -xxx=false not -xxx false
          
          For parameters which must have a value it may be given in either way
---------------
Some parameters may also be set from alternative sources such as configuration
files or environment variables. For more details use the help-show-sources
parameter.
